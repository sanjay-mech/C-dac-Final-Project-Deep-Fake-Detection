# C-dac-Final-Project-Deep-Fake-Detection
The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to detect objects and extract text from images ( optional and videos). By leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and deep learning models, the system will accurately identify and classify objects, providing precise localization and labeling information.
# 1. Introduction
This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like MTCNN and MesoNet#. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features. 
2.Dataset
We have use FaceForensics Deepfake dataset. dataset can be access from given link . [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sorokin/faceforensics)
