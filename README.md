# C-dac-Final-Project-Deep-Fake-Detection
The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to detect objects and extract text from images ( optional and videos). By leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and deep learning models, the system will accurately identify and classify objects, providing precise localization and labeling information.
